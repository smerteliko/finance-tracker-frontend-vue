### 4\. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to specify the backend API URL.

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### 5\. Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 6\. Running Tests

To run the unit tests with Vitest, run:

```bash
npm run test
